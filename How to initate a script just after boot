You will need root privileges for any the following. To get root, open a terminal and run the command

sudo su

and the command prompt will change to '#' indicating that the terminal session has root privileges.

......................Alternative #1. Add an initscript.

Create a new script in /etc/init.d/myscript.

vi /etc/init.d/myscript

(Obviously it doesn't have to be called "myscript".) In this script, do whatever you want to do. Perhaps just run the script you mentioned.

#!/bin/sh
/path/to/my/script.sh

Make it executable.

chmod ugo+x /etc/init.d/myscript

Configure the init system to run this script at startup.

update-rc.d myscript defaults

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Alternative #2. Add commands to /etc/rc.local

vi /etc/rc.local

with content like the following.

# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel
/path/to/my/script.sh || exit 1   # Added by me
exit 0

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Alternative #3. Add an Upstart job.

Create /etc/init/myjob.conf

vi /etc/init/myjob.conf

with content like the following

description     "my job"
start on startup
task
exec /path/to/my/script.sh
