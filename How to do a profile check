(i still don't know how to make a profile but i will find out by god's will :))


**first command to help  see the device overlay loaded

>>>export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.8/slots

**second command to help see pin configuration 

>>>>export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins

**third command to check your profile 

>>> more .profile

**the output is supposed to be like this:
>>export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
>>export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.8/slots
>>export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins

**to run your profile another time in another occasion just use this command 

>> . ~/.profile

** to see wich dto is loaded just do as follow

>> cat $SLOTS (or >>cat $SLOTS|more  , for a better view that option works with every command that has a lon output)

** to see the pin configuration just type 

>> cat $PINS (or cat $PINS|grep 878 ,to see the pin with the offset 878, i took 878 for example it is the offset for Pin_9_12)
